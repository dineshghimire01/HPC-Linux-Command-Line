Create account at https://biohpc.cornell.edu//login_bio.aspx

Check if your user password works on biohpc : https://biohpc.cornell.edu//login_bio.aspx 

Then you can access with your user in terminal via ssh e.g. ssh dg663@cbsurobbins.biohpc.cornell.edu

So now you will need to use slurm to submit jobs. There are examples on this directory: /local/workdir/slurm_starter_pack

Look at the README file on that directory it has links to more information on the biohpc site. You can pretty much follow the example and run a job. 
The main idea is that you can split jobs into different smaller tasks and have the cluster run them.

* General Information:  
The cluster consists of 16 compute nodes. All these nodes are part of the BioHPC Cloud, with all the software and tools available in the Cloud also available on the cluster nodes
