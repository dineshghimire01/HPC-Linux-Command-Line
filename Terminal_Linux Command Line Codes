Terminal_Linux Command Line Codes: Type of command or function, its code, what it does and examples attached herewith. 

1. Current Directory: pwd
What it does: If you want to find out which directory you are in : type pwd
eg. /Users/dg663

2. Change Directory : cd
What it does: The cd command will change the directory you’re currently working within Terminal to execute other commands on a different directory.
Example: cd “path/to/directory/” like cd Desktop

3. Listing Directory: ls
What it does: Use ls command after navigating into a directory using the cd command to view the contents inside of the current directory. 
Example: ls and get everthing inside that directory.
Also, Use the argument -l command with ls to get even more information about each of the files.
Eg.  ls -l

4. Open Files: open 
What it does: When browsing a directory, you may encounter a file that you wish to open on your Mac. That’s where the open command comes in. 
Example: open “filename” i.e. open Dinesh     
and then a real dolder of Dinesh will open up in the new desktop window. 

5. Copy a file to another directory: cp
What it does: The cp command facilitates copying a file from one location to another or making a copy of the same file with a new name. 
Example: cp “filename” “newfilename with directory” i.e.  cp  Disease.docx  /Users/dg663/Documents/Disease.docx 
By doing so, I copied that file named Disease.docx into documents folder.

6. Move a file: mv
What it does: When you don’t want to copy a file, but instead move it, use the same format of the cp command, but instead replace cp with mv.
Example: mv “filename” “path/to/new/file/location” i.e.  mv Disease.docx /Users/dg663 (moved to dg663 folder)

7. Create a text file: touch
What it does: The touch command allows you to create any type of file, but it’s blank. 
After you create the blank file, you can open it in a text editor by typing open [filename].
Example: touch myfile.txt , also touch myfile.doc or touch myfile.csv
Then open myfile.txt   to open it. 

8. Create a directory or folder: mkdir
What it does: The mkdir command will allow you to create a directory (folder) from within the CLI. 
When you need a place to store new files, just use this command to add a new directory in the current working directory, or specify a full path to the location where you want the new directory to be placed.
Example: mkdir “path/to/new/directory” i.e. mkdir /Users/dg663/new so here a new folder created inside dg663

9. Rename folder: mv 
What it does: When you’ve created a folder that has the wrong name, you can easily use the mv command to rename it.
Eg. mv "oldfilename" "newfilename" i.e. mv myfile.txt file.txt

10. Remove an empty directory: rmdir
What it does: If you want to remove a directory altogether, use the rmdir command followed by the path to the directory.
Example: rmdir “path/to/directory” i.e rmdir /Users/dg663/new now removes that new folder.
